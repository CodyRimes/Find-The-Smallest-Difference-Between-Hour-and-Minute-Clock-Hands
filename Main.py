#This program will take in the users input for the hour hand and minute hand (by the time on the clock)
#And will calculate shortest difference in distance by degrees between the two hands (there would be two ways to measure the distance in degrees on a clock, you could go around the long way, or go the shorter way between the two hands)


hourHandInputResponse = input("Please enter the time on your clock. First we will take the input of the hour hand: ")
print(f"The number we received was, {hourHandInputResponse}")

print("Please enter the input for the minute hand")
